description:  As part of a project at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, my team and I developed a mobile terrestrial robot that mimics the movement of an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV). Ultimately intended as a platform for future marine robotics students, the project involved the complete design, prototyping, and fabrication process of the robot. I was responsible for ROS2 integration, software architecture, and testing. This page outline my key contributions throughout the project.
