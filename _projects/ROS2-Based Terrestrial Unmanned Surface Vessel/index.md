title: ROS2-Based Terrestrial Unmanned Surface Vessel
description:  As part of a project at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, my team and I developed a mobile terrestrial robot that mimics the movement of an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV). Ultimately intended as a platform for future marine robotics students, the project involved the complete design, prototyping, fabrication, and implementation of the robot. I was responsible for ROS2 integration, software architecture, and testing. This page will discuss the design process for the robot and outline my key contributions throughout the project.

## Motivation, Objectives, and Design
- Why simulate a USV on land?
- Robot should move in a 2D plane with 3 independent Degrees of Freedom (DOF).
- Untethered

To replicate USV-like motion, caster wheels were chosen. This allowed for motion on a 2D plane with 3 DOF. For propulsion, ducted fans, used for remote controlled planes, were used along with an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC).

## Challenges and Future Directions
