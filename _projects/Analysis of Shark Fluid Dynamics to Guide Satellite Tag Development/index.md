title: Hydrodynamic Analysis of Sharks to Guide Satellite Tag Design
description: This project, completed as part of my undergraduate capstone at Oregon State University, analyzed the hydrodynamic impact of satellite telemetry tags on sharks. Using CFD modeling and wind tunnel validation, our team developed a repeatable methodology to evaluate tag-induced drag and lift across different shark species.

## Tools Used
CFD Software: STAR-CCM+
Modeling/Prep: Blender, SolidWorks, Fusion 360
Experimental Setup: Arduino Nano, Strain Guages
Fabrication: Ultimaker S5 (ABS), HP MJF (PA12)
Data Analysis: MATLAB, Excel

## Motivation
- The Problem? Satellite tags are essential for tracking shark movements, but they unintentionally affect a shark's behavior due to added hydrodynamic load.
- Design Gap: Existing tag designs have limited validation of their effect on shark motion, making it difficult to optimize for minimal interference.
- Our Mission: Develop a repeatable method to qualtify the hydrodynamic impact of telemetry tags using accurate modeling and physical testing.

### Digital Modeling
#### Four shark species were selected:
- Shortfin Mako
- Caribbean Reef
- Blacktip Reef
- Great Hammerhead


- We used photogrammetric 3D models of each shark provided to us from DigitalLife3D. These models were both prepared for 3D printing and STAR-CCM+.
