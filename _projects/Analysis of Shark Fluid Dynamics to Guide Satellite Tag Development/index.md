title: Hydrodynamic Analysis of Sharks to Guide Satellite Tag Design
description: In this project, completed as part of my undergraduate capstone at Oregon State University, I analyzed the hydrodynamic impact of satellite telemetry tags on sharks. Using CFD modeling and wind tunnel validation, the team and I developed a repeatable methodology to evaluate tag-induced drag and lift across different shark species.

## Digital Modeling

### Shark Species Modeled
- Shortfin Mako (*Isurus oxyrinchus*)
- Caribbean Reef (*Carcharhinus perezii*)
- Blacktip Reef (*Carcharhinus limbatus*)
- Great Hammerhead (*Sphyrna mokarran*)

Photogrammetric 3D models were sourced from **DigitalLife3D**, processed for STAR-CCM+ simulation and 3D printing.

## Key Findings
- Lift coefficients ranged from **−0.02 to 0.37**.
- Drag coefficients ranged from **0.14 to 0.21**.
- CFD models matched wind tunnel results within **<10% error**.
- Surface finish (ABS vs PA12) had **negligible impact**.
- **Shortfin Mako** had the lowest drag; **Great Hammerhead** had higher lift due to cephalofoil geometry.

## Reflection

This project brought together mechanical design, marine biology, and computational physics to solve a real conservation-driven engineering challenge. It provided hands-on experience with CAD modeling, CFD validation, and experimental methods. I'm proud to have contributed to a methodology that may support future biologging innovations.

## Improvements and Future Work
- Attach tag models to shark geometries and run new simulations.
- Incorporate dynamic (unsteady) flow modeling to capture fin/body flexion.
- Apply transition models (e.g., Gamma-Re-Theta) to improve turbulence resolution.
- Explore riblet surfaces or coatings inspired by shark skin to reduce drag on tags.
