title: Hydrodynamic Analysis of Sharks to Guide Satellite Tag Design
description: In this project, completed as part of my undergraduate capstone at Oregon State University, I analyzed the hydrodynamic impact of satellite telemetry tags on sharks. Using CFD modeling and wind tunnel validation, the team and I developed a repeatable methodology to evaluate tag-induced drag and lift across different shark species.

## Methodology

### ðŸ“Œ Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- 3D shark models obtained via photogrammetry.
- Simulated in STAR-CCM+ with SST k-Ï‰ turbulence model.
- Tested at 3 angles of attack: âˆ’12Â°, 0Â°, +12Â°.
- Lift and drag coefficients computed and visualized.

## Digital Modeling

### Shark Species Modeled
- Shortfin Mako (*Isurus oxyrinchus*)
- Caribbean Reef (*Carcharhinus perezii*)
- Blacktip Reef (*Carcharhinus limbatus*)
- Great Hammerhead (*Sphyrna mokarran*)

We used photogrammetric 3D models from **DigitalLife3D**, prepared for both 3D printing and CFD simulation.

## Reflection

This project highlighted the real-world value of combining computational analysis with physical experimentation. The interdisciplinary work â€” spanning marine biology, fluid mechanics, CAD modeling, and fabrication â€” helped prepare me for further work in marine robotics and hydrodynamics.

## Future Improvements

- Add satellite tag models to shark meshes and re-run CFD/wind tunnel trials.
- Explore dynamic (unsteady) fluid simulation.
- Refine mesh for turbulence transition modeling.
- Incorporate drag reduction strategies from nature (riblets, coatings, etc.).
